Telemetry Streamline. Real-Time Device
Insights Platform
Problem
Organizations managing distributed devices lack real-time visibility into device performance.
Telemetry arrives late, unstructured, or incomplete, causing slow incident detection, poor
diagnostics, and higher operational costs.
Goal
Build a production-grade, serverless streaming ETL system that ingests telemetry in real time,
validates and enriches events, tracks lineage, detects anomalies, and makes both real-time and
historical analytics instantly accessible.
Solution
I designed a fully serverless telemetry pipeline using AWS Kinesis, Lambda, DynamoDB,
OpenSearch, S3, Glue, Athena, and Redshift.
Devices publish JSON telemetry to Kinesis. A Schema Validator Lambda enforces structure
using a Schema Registry. An enrichment Lambda adds metadata and writes lineage records.
Clean events are routed to DynamoDB for latest device state, OpenSearch for diagnostics, and
S3 as the raw event lake. An anomaly-detection Lambda triggers alerts via SNS. Glue Catalog
and Athena enable SQL-based analytics. Redshift provides warehouse-scale querying. All
infrastructure is deployed with Terraform and continuously delivered via GitHub Actions.
CloudWatch and X-Ray provide logging, metrics, and tracing.
Architecture
Kinesis → Validator Lambda → Enrichment + Lineage → Router → DynamoDB (state) /
OpenSearch (search) / S3 (raw lake) → Athena/Redshift
Supports schema registry, lineage store, anomaly alerts, DLQ processing, and full IaC + CI/CD.
